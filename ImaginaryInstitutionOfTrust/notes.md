Title: The Imaginary Institution of Trust -- Sandbox
---

 * in order to historicize technological developments it is important to get deeper into dynamics and perspectives of developers, to follow their epystemological vectors (lol), understand their desires, imagineries, preferences, oral histories.... to see how much of that is present in literature (especially the ones outside of western world)
 
 
-- developer communities are key to pluralism and dynamism of technological development, institutional governance models tend to overlook that dynamic, however in order to historicize the trajectory of technological development that perspective is equally formative and necessary -- i.e. what are the epistemologies, visions, desires and imaginaries of developers

-- given the paths not taken, technological development historically remained within the horizon of technological optimisation that benefits the community and occludes the view of the pluralism and antagonism between communites and positions that form the society
