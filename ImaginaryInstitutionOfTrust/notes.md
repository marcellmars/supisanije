Title: The Imaginary Institution of Trust -- Sandbox
---

STUKTURA TEKSTA:
- intro: u tehno svijetu povjerenje se delegira na formalizaciju komunikacijskog kanala/medija
- bitni keywordi: trust, technocommunity, end to end, formalization
 * Alice & Bob: end to end kripto
 * end-to-end engines of formalization: open markets, private property and nation states. via vision of smartness, efficiency and autonomy black box/engine with in/out flow
 * kripto community: postignuće & posljedice
 * scaling-up: google wave (institucionalni okvir -- google kompanija, ali institucija bez ideje društva fejla), the dao & internet
 * kada podignemo scale, trust faila jer je u pitanju kompleksnost i konfliktnost --> društveno
 * 

2. Internet and the failure of technological governmentality
* level playing field in communication leads to an unequal worlds
* inequalities in the world as a result of post-1989 unfettered capitalist expansion, simplification and replacement of politics with technological governmentality
* participation vs accumulation
* rise of technogovernmentality and demise of social governmentality



 * in order to historicize technological developments it is important to get deeper into dynamics and perspectives of developers, to follow their epystemological vectors (lol), understand their desires, imagineries, preferences, oral histories.... to see how much of that is present in literature (especially the ones outside of western world)
 
 
* developer communities are key to pluralism and dynamism of technological development, institutional governance models tend to overlook that dynamic, however in order to historicize the trajectory of technological development that perspective is equally formative and necessary -- i.e. what are the epistemologies, visions, desires and imaginaries of developers

* given the paths not taken, technological development historically remained within the horizon of technological optimisation that benefits the community and occludes the view of the pluralism and antagonism between communites and positions that form the society
